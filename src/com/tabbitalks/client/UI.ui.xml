							Today is Remembrance Day, a day where we hold a two minute
							silence at 11am to commemorate those that died during the First
							World War in addition to marking the day that the war ended on
							November 11th 1918.
							
								Since then there has of course been World War 2 and as far as
								I’m concerned everything that has been and is still happening in
								the middle east may as well be deemed World War 3, a world at
								war time and time again. The wars will not be the end of the
								world, it will be a reason why the human race will end if we
								keep killing each other, the only thing that can lead to the
								worlds true destruction, would be found out if we carry on to
								ignore the signs of Global Warming.
								But I digress, I can only be thankful to all those that have died
								and continue to die in the name of my safety, and remorseful for
								all the families that are carrying on without their loved ones.
								During this two minute silence today I will be grateful to all
								those families that have had loved ones fight for us, defending
								our way of living and yet my heart will bleed, because there are
								so many innocents dying at the hands of those at war; women,
								children, men, when will it end? I fear it will never truly be
								over, there are so many reasons the human race will find to have
								at each other, but during this silence I will be thankful for
								the safety that has been provided to my country, and in the
								words of Mahatma Gandhi, I will aim to be the change I want to
								see in the world.
