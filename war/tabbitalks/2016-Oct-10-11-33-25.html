  <p class="font-weight-normal"> Technology! It's everywhere and in pretty much everything, whether we notice or not. 
I've recently had my eyes opened to the awe inspiring world that is the Techno World and had a brief look at what goes on behind the curtains so to say, and let me start by saying: HOLY MACARONI!! What appears to be so simple has so much running behind it, it's not even funny.<br>
<br>
Take for example, instant messenger! It's instant right? Hey, how are you? Good? Good, glad you got that snake out of your boot; hit send, badabing badaboom message sent and received!  But in order for that message to have been sent and to have been received, it needed all this coding and sh*t that I can't really remember because there was so much behind it all that my mind was well and truly blown.<br>
<br>
Now, don't get me wrong I knew that there was more to it than just hitting send on a message and it magically appearing to the recipient, BUT I have been trying, desperately trying, to create my own website for my personal blog (hi there, this is that blog!) but for the love of all things pizza shaped I literally had no idea how much coding it takes to perform what seems to be such a simple action once it's up and running!<br>
<br>
Luckily for me I know someone who has a Degree in computer science and God bless him he tries really hard to make all this hullabaloo easy for me to understand and experiment with, and although I can code some things, such as this blog post for example, I cannot for the life of me do stuff that requires JavaScript or any fancy schmancy stuff like that.<br>
<br>
I am currently a work in progress as is this blog in the Techno World, I'm hoping that now I am making a more proactive effort to create my own blogs rather than using a template on a blog site, that I will pick it up and that hey, maybe somebody will appreciate the effort, no? Meh, worth a try XD lol<br>
<br>
I'm sure once I;m more programming savvy you;ll notice a big difference in the appearance of my personal blog site, until then, enjoy the basics and easy to read blog posts! :P<br>
<br>

  Sending love and light til we blog again,<br>
