<p class="font-weight-normal">"In a family portrait we look pretty happy, let's play pretend and act like it comes naturally." -P!nk - Family Portrait<br>
<br>
On October 10th, Mental Health Awareness Day was made apparent to us once again, we saw it on our Facebook News feeds, we saw it on our Instagram's with celebrities posting themed pictures for the cause; we saw it on most tabloids Facebook pages also.<br>
<br>
Mental, close your eyes and say that word to yourself, mental, what is the first thing that comes to mind? For me initially I can hear a bunch of rambunctious teens exclaiming how "mental" a gig was, I see a comical image of a guy rambling to himself in a straight jacket rocking back and forth in a padded cell, I envision a mad man running amok on the streets wearing clown masks getting kicks from scaring people; and yet the thing I see the most clearly is the stigma that surrounds mental health.<br>
<br>
For you see, there are many shapes and forms of mental health, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia to name a very few, and when the public hears of someone with depression or any other form of a mental health issue, there's an immediate outcry of "attention seeker, get over yourself, it's not the end of the world, there are others worse off than you!" Etc. There is no sympathy, there is not many willing to relate, I mean, who would want to relate to someone who isn't a perfect, all together human being, right? <br>
<br>
I was inspired by all the awareness and wanted to generate my own awareness for the cause, last night I lay in bed planning a video to implore those that feel that they may be suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts to go and seek help, to TALK to someone, to say something; and it was on that thought that I then fell into my welcomed slumber. <br>
<br>
I had a dream, I very rarely have dreams but last night I did, I was hurrying to go somewhere as per usual; I had the impending sense that time was running out, that I was going to be late for something, I heaved a heavy sigh, looked around me and looked up at the glass ceiling of Canary Wharf DLR Station, it was so bright and high up it made my head spin momentarily. I tried to gather my thoughts, why am I here? What am I waiting for? Where am I going? All I knew was that I was waiting for the train and as soon as I realised this the train arrived, but it was stopping; it was speeding past and it seemed like a never ending train, it sped faster and faster past and as I was looking through the windows I could see my memories from traumatic times play out inside the carriages. I could see my younger self experiencing all of this pain, seeing and experiencing things a child at that age shouldn't be witness to and my heart broke upon seeing the light in this little girls eyes with each flashing memory grow duller and darker. <br>
<br>
That little girl was me and I have all of these repressed memories that I like to forget because remembering them opens up what I call a black hole of emotion sucking all forms of happiness from me; I turned away from the train, overloaded with the flashbacks, as I turned to find a bench to sit down at I saw a lovely lady whom I used to work with and I felt an overwhelming sense of relief! I pretty much ran to her and sat down next to her, happy for the distraction from the train that just wouldn't go past, we talked, we catched up and then she looked at me with concern on her face and asked me what was bothering me? <br>
<br>
I was taken aback, had I given myself away? Was I looking sad or anxious, I then briefly explained some of the things that had happened to me to make me feel so ... depressed, worthless, suicidal and she sat up, smiled and told me it was going to be okay; that she could phone social services and get them to question my mother on all of these things and as she said that I felt all of the fear I had when I was a little girl, anxious to please her mother, desperate for her positive affection, willing to do anything and keep anything hidden away that would upset my mother and when I spoke, it was in a childlike voice. <br>
<br>
I told her that there was no need, I was fine, just being dramatic, it's all in my head, just attention seeking, if social services questioned mummy it would upset her and she would question, "why did you do this to me? I've done nothing but look after you, you ungrateful bitch, you're dead to me." <br>
<br>
My old colleague smiled sadly at me, nodded her head and took me over to a place at the station where there was a box of hamsters, wonderful, cute little hamsters and as I was discussing how cute they were to another person near by my son woke me up with his morning feed cry. <br>
<br>
I woke up, it was a dream, a dream that inspired me to write this blog, you may not know me and I may not know you but I know of the darkness that surrounds depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts and I have a new found urge to express that YOU ARE NOT ALONE.  <br>
<br>
All of our situations are different but irregardless to what is the trigger you must TALK to someone, a friend, a trusted family member and if there is no one close you feel you can trust there are wonderful charities that can help you understand your emotions; you are NOT a freak, you are NOT attention seeking, you are WORTHY of living life happily; you are a WONDERFUL, UNIQUE, human being and I implore you with all of my heart, please, if for any reason you feel like there is something wrong TALK to somebody about it! <br>
<br>
Mental health can corrode inside our heads, the longer you leave it the more of your thoughts it will occupy until you are tricked into thinking you have no other option than to end your life just to stop feeling so much silent suffering. DON'T be silent, in the words of Otep Shamaya STAND UP, SPEAK OUT, FIGHT BACK. <br>
<br>
You are LOVE, you are LIFE and you are WORTHY of HAPPINESS, spread light around the world, let the mental health awareness day inspire others to come forward and seek help, you are not weak for asking for help, you are brave and you can overcome. Your mental health matters, YOU MATTER. <br>
