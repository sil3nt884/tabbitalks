 <p> My son and I were on the DLR making our way home, I told him about this cool recipe for Nutella hot chocolate that I found and how we could get into some comfy pjays and make some to warm up (it was pretty damn cold today). 

We were minding our own business chatting away when these two tiny early teenage boys shrugged past us as they headed towards the doors, my son saw them heading for the doors and pressed the button opening the doors for them, they stepped off not thanking him then one of them turned and pointed at my son and shouted "you have no soul!"

My son has red hair or ginger hair depending on how you view it, inherited by me and my Scottish genetics; now I know of this whole 'gingers have no souls' thing, there's been many a reference and too many pictures with that caption, normally I don't give a toss about a small minded person referencing an insult they couldn't think up themselves, however, these two boys, who were old enough to know they were being asshats, had directed this terminology towards my six year old son.

I reacted instinctively and shouted "I beg your pardon!? Don't be so rude! The doors closed, they smirked and as the train went past them they pointed again and shouted "Ginger!" at my son. I was beyond angry, I was fuming, more so at the knowledge that these boys were teens and they were ridiculing a child, A CHILD. I was incredulous to the whole concept, when did it become acceptable to insult and ridicule a child? 

Whilst I was fuming silently my son turned to me and asked what the boys had said, I told him not to worry about it, I didn't want him to be upset, yet he said "Okay, but I would like to know what they said mummy." As we reached our destination I told him how they just shouted out the colour of his hair because people with brains the size of peanuts think that shouting the colour of your hair is funny, my son laughed, rolled his eyes and continued to talk about the ingredients we'd need to get for our Nutella hot chocolate.

When I saw how unfazed my son was and how he carried on like nothing had happened, my heart swelled and ached at the same time, I felt so happy that he knew those idiots were being just that and didn't care at all, I then felt the ache; the ache of wondering where that childlike innocence went in those teens, does puberty really smack all of it out of us? At what point do we switch from being a happy go lucky, world full of wonders kid happy to a teen finding joy in insulting a child?

Thinking back I knew that foolish teen was only trying to impress his friend and make him laugh, however I still have a bitter taste in my mouth when I think it was at the expense of my son. 

We got our ingredients from a little shop near our house, got home, changed into our pjays and I begun supervising my son with the making of the Nutella hot chocolate, he had fun boiling the ingredients and whisking it all together and especially enjoyed spraying cream on the top and sprinkling on some shaved chocolate and hot chocolate powder.

My children are my inspiration, they are my hope that there is some good in this world, on days like today where I get swallowed by my protective parenting anger, and I see how light hearted my children are, I try to loosen the grip of that outrage and carry on with being happy with my two sons.</p>
