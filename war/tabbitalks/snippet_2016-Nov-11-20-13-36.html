<p><b> “Be the change you want to see in the world.” - Mahatma Gandhi.</b><br>
<br>
Today is Remembrance Day, a day where we hold a two minute silence at 11am to commemorate those that died during the First World War in addition to marking the day that the war ended on November 11th 1918.<br>
<br>
Since then there has of course been World War 2 and as far as I’m concerned everything that has been and is still happening in the middle east may as well be deemed World War 3, a world at war time and time again. The wars will not be the end of the world, it will be a reason why the human race will end if we keep killing each other, the only thing that can lead to the worlds true destruction, would be found out if we carry on to ignore the signs of Global Warming. 

But I digress, I can only be thankful to all those that have died and continue to die in the name of my safety, and remorseful for all the families that are carrying on without their loved ones. During this two minute silence today I will be grateful to all those families that have had loved ones fight for us, defending our way of living and yet my heart will bleed, because there are so many innocents dying at the hands of those at war; women, children, men, when will it end? I fear it will never truly be over, there are so many reasons the human race will find to have at each other, but during this silence I will be thankful for the safety that has been provided to my country, and in the words of Mahatma Gandhi, I will aim to be the change I want to see in the world.<br>
