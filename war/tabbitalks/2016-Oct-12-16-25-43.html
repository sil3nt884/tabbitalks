I laugh every time I see this picture, it is stupidly accurate donâ€™t you think?

I was introduced to this game through an old partner, it looked cool and there were a lot of champions to pick and play with so I was optimistic on trying out a new game, I wasn't told very much other than to 'Q' with my first champion Annie whenever a minions health was low. That was it, no guidance on what to buy, heck I didn't even know what the hell to buy let alone buying anything at all, I didnâ€™t know what kind of champion she was I just liked the look of her plain and simple. Obviously I died and resurrected more times than Jesus, I was a complete and utter â€˜noob.â€™ I received flame after flame and nearly drowned in the sea of saltiness from other players.

I was upset and refused to play the game ever again, nobody was willing to show me the ropes, the tutorial for me at the time was basic and didn't cover everything that is needed to be known when you play, and so I stopped playing, for years and years I hated the game and all of the vile, rude players I'd encountered. That is, until my boyfriend reintroduced me to it, I was very reluctant to play at first and told him about how bad my first experience of the game was, he laughed and smiled this bright reassuring smile that he always pulls out when I'm unsure of anything and said that he was level 30, played for years and still gets people being salty, it's just how it is on League BUT there are also decent players (like himself)
</p>

And so I went back onto the game, a fresh account, brand new summoner name and everything, I wasnâ€™t expecting to have any fun at all, just to get lost in all the confusion again; but over time my boyfriend taught me how to play, and no I definitely ain't no professional!! BUT I am more knowledgeable in what to do with myself in the game nowðŸ˜„ what items I need to buy for what champion I use, the lanes and what everyone's role in that lane is lalalalalala  there was more than I thought that needed to be taken in, and granted I'm still learning, but I can honestly say I have enjoyed learning about League and even though I still encounter salty or mean players, my boyfriend has made my sensitive soul happier by showing me the mute button and that if they are really salty to report them where a tribunal will deem if they need to be banned for a bit.

I never thought I'd play this game again, but here I am with a level 30 account and although I'm no where near IMAQTPIE's skill of playing, I am having fun in the process, something which I would never have thought possible before. I like watching people play, I enjoy other player's guides on how to play certain champs and I like experimenting with different builds for different champs! If you would have told me this when I first started I wouldn't have known wtf a build is lol.

I had fun playing with my boyfriend on League last night, one match we had an extremely vile player on the enemy team that was shouting all sorts of abuse, it agitated me because I like to play for fun and yet there are so many people that aggro like they're tied to a bomb that will blow if they don't win?? I reported them not thinking much of it until I got a message from Riot saying that the person had been banned because of my reporting and I was like, yay the system actually works?? lol

I wish that would encourage people to be less salty on League buuuut it's League! Where there are Legends there are also extreme Assholes!??

The match after that one we had a team of really friendly players that were also very good, it was fun to play and fun to watch them! It's good games like that, that keep me interested in the game, and I've also learned not to take every salty thing to heart??
<br>
So yay me?
