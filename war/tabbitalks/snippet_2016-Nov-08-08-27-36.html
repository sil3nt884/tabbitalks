 <p> My son and I were on the DLR making our way home, I told him about this cool recipe for Nutella hot chocolate that I found and how we could get into some comfy pjays and make some to warm up (it was pretty damn cold today). 

We were minding our own business chatting away when these two tiny early teenage boys shrugged past us as they headed towards the doors, my son saw them heading for the doors and pressed the button opening the doors for them, they stepped off not thanking him then one of them turned and pointed at my son and shouted “ you have no soul!”

My son has red hair or ginger hair depending on how you view it, inherited by me and my Scottish genetics; now I know of this whole ‘gingers have no souls’ thing, there’s been many a reference and too many pictures with that caption, normally I don’t give a toss about a small minded person referencing an insult they couldn’t think up themselves, however, these two boys, who were old enough to know they were being asshats, had directed this terminology towards my six year old son.
