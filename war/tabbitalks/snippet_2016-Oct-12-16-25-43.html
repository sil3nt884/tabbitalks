I laugh every time I see this picture, it is stupidly accurate don't you think?

I was introduced to this game through an old partner, it looked cool and there were a lot of champions to pick and play with so I was optimistic on trying out a new game, I wasn't told very much other than to 'Q' with my first champion Annie whenever a minions health was low. That was it, no guidance on what to buy, heck I didn't even know what the hell to buy let alone buying anything at all, I didn't know what kind of champion she was I just liked the look of her plain and simple. Obviously I died and resurrected more times than Jesus, I was a complete and utter 'noob'. I received flame after flame and nearly drowned in the sea of saltiness from other players.
